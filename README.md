# SecureSphere Tech Solutions - Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a neural network using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. It achieves high accuracy through image preprocessing and efficient model training on 60,000 samples. This is part of the **Artificial Intelligence Internship Program** at **SecureSphere Tech Solutions**.

## Project Overview

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a key application of computer vision, using deep learning to classify digits (0-9) from 28x28 grayscale images. The model demonstrates the power of neural networks for recognizing patterns and achieving high prediction accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: A fully connected feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers and **ReLU** activation.
- **Softmax Classification**: Outputs the probabilities for each digit class.
- **Image Preprocessing**: MNIST images are normalized and reshaped for optimal neural network input.
- **Training & Evaluation**: The model uses the **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**, with accuracy and loss tracked during training.
- **Performance Visualization**: Plots of training accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix are generated to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network.
- **Python**: Primary language for the implementation.
- **MNIST Dataset**: A popular dataset of handwritten digits.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing training performance and evaluation metrics.
